# Attention
If you want to develop this application, here I have prepared a file containing PHP and MySQL database files. After that, all you have to do is:
* **Change the connection.php file according to the localhost you have**
* **Change the link url in the Connection package -> InitRetrofit.class according to the link on localhost or web hosting that you have**
* **Then, if you are using Android OS 8.0 and above, please enter the res-> xml-> networkSecurityConfig.xml folder then change the url according to the one on localhost / web hosting that you have**

Thank you, don't forget to give a star for the Android project that I share with you.
See you next time!
